Her first short film, Peel (1982), won the Short Film Palme d'Or 
        at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival, and other awards followed for 
        the shorts Passionless Moments (1983), A Girl's Own Story (1984) 
        and After Hours (1984). Having left the Australian Film and Television 
        School she directed an episode for ABC's light entertainment series 
        Dancing Daze (1986), which led to her first TV film, Two Friends (1986) produced by Jan Chapman

 Sweetie (1989) was her feature debut, and won international awards. 
        Further recognition followed with An Angel at My Table (1990), a 
        biographical and psychological portrayal of the New Zealand writer 
        Janet Frame. International recognition followed with another Palme d'Or 
        at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival for The Piano, which won the best director 
        award from the Australian Film Institute and an Academy Award for 
        Best Original Screenplay in 1994. At the 66th Academy Awards, 
        she was the second woman ever to be nominated for Best Director.

Campion's work since that time has tended to polarize opinion. 
        The Portrait of a Lady (1996), based on the Henry James novel, 
        featured Nicole Kidman, John Malkovich, Barbara Hershey and Martin Donovan. 
        Holy Smoke! (1999) teamed Campion again with Harvey Keitel, this time with 
        Kate Winslet as the female lead. In the Cut (2003), an erotic thriller based 
        on Susanna Moore's bestseller, provided Meg Ryan an opportunity to depart 
        from her more familiar onscreen persona. Her 2009 film Bright Star, a 
        biographical drama about poet John Keats (played by Ben Whishaw) and his 
        lover Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish), was shown at the Cannes Film Festival.

Campion was an executive producer for the 2006 documentary Abduction: 
        The Megumi Yokota Story and was creator, writer and director of the serial
         Top of the Lake. The mini-series received near universal acclaim with its 
         lead actress Elisabeth Moss winning numerous awards including a Golden Globe 
         Award for Best Actress – Miniseries or Television Film and a Critics' Choice 
         Television Award for Best Actress in a Movie/Miniseries as well as a Primetime 
         Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Miniseries or a Movie nomination. 
         Campion herself was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing 
         for a Miniseries, Movie or a Dramatic Special.

She was the head of the jury for the Cinéfondation and Short Film sections 
        at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival. and the head of the jury for the main 
        competition section for the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. During his speech when 
        collecting the Prix du Jury for his film Mommy, Canadian filmmaker Xavier Dolan 
        said of Campion's The Piano that "It made me want to write roles for women: 
        beautiful women with soul, will and strength, not victims or objects." 
        Campion responded by rising from her seat to give him a hug.

In 2014 it was announced that Campion was nearing a deal to direct an adaptation 
        of Rachel Kushner's novel The Flamethrowers.       

In 2015 Campion confirmed that she would be co-directing and co-writing a second 
            season of Top of the Lake with the action moved to Sydney and Harbour City, 
            Hong Kong with Elisabeth Moss reprising her role as Robin Griffin.
